Siamese networks excelled in classification with triplet loss for precision. TensorFlow was lauded for ease, flexibility, and GPU support. ResNet, a powerful deep learning architecture, handled data preprocessing and classification effectively. The results of this model were a loss of under 1% on training data and an accuracy of 89% on validation data. This was my bachelor project
